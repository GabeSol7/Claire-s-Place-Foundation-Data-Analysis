# Claire's Place Foundation Data Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The **Claire's Place Foundation** is a non-profit organization that provides emotional and financial support to families and individuals affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). This project quantifies the foundation's impact using data from grant applications and highlights opportunities for improving data collection and analysis.

### Key Challenges:
1. How do we effectively quantify the foundation's impact on the CF community?
2. Are we collecting the right information to showcase the foundation's impact?
3. What improvements can be made to enhance future data collection and analysis?

## Goals of Claire's Place Foundation

- **Vision**: Providing emotional and financial support to families living with cystic fibrosis (CF).
- **Mission**: Claire's Place Foundation supports families by raising awareness and providing education, financial assistance, and emotional support.
